# ðŸ§© NixOS Undetected Chromedriver Development Template

This is a **template for undetected Chromedriver development on NixOS**.

I use an **`aarch64` laptop**, so using `webdriver-manager` was problematic.  
Additionally, I encountered **Chromium crashes when `TMPDIR` was not set**.

Maybe there are simpler approaches, Iâ€™ve found this setup to be best but feel free to contribute.
